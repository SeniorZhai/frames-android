# Module Frames Android SDK

Start accepting online payments in just a few minutes with our Android SDK. It's quick and easy to integrate, accepts online payments from all major credit cards, and is customizable to your brand.

## Features

#### Two ways to integrate:
- [Use our native UI](https://www.checkout.com/docs/integrate/sdks/android-sdk#Usage_(with_the_module's_UI)) and embed the fully customisable form to accept card details, customer name and billing details and exchange them for a secure token.
- [Build your own UI](https://www.checkout.com/docs/integrate/sdks/android-sdk#Usage_(without_the_module's_UI)) and use the provided API to send sensitive data to the Checkout.com server and retrieve the secure token.

**Accept cards and Google Pay** easily using our UI and tokenization module to stay away from PCI-compliance.

**Handle 3D Secure verification** within a WebView.
